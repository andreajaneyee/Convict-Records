# Convict-Records
Date: Semester 2, 2016<br><br>
This web application was a university group project for the course DECO3801. Our team, Team Orange, collaborated with the Queensland State Archives to create a digital layer that would allow people to access the data taken from the Moreton Bay Convict Records. My team member, Ellen, and I designed the mockups and did the front-end development for it. Another member, Tina, did all the back-end for it which includes PHP, MySQL, and making sense of all the CSV files that were a mess.

NOTE: GitHub pages does not support PHP which means some functions won't work. 
ANOTHER NOTE: I am aware that the directory is a mess but half of the team did not function most of the time so it was a miracle that we submitted something.
